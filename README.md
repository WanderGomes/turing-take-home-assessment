- NPM v10+

## Introduction

Welcome to the Turing Take-Home Assessment project, developed by [Wander Rocha Gomes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wanderrochagomes/).

Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it, as I had to stop midway through the assessment to resolve an urgent issue at my current job. However, I did my best.

### What was done in the project?

The project was built entirely using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (with the SASS/SCSS preprocessor). No third-party libraries were used.

First, I created a Git repository to version control my project. You can access it through this link: https://github.com/WanderGomes/turing-take-home-assessment

Then, I structured the project following the organization standards I usually apply. I like to follow industry best practices when naming folders, files, and components.

I am very familiar with best practices, so I applied some of them in this project:

- **SASS 7-1 Pattern**, which organizes styles into seven categories.
- **BEM CSS**, a methodology for writing CSS class names.
- **Conventional Commits**, a standard for commit messages.
- **JS and React naming conventions** for components and classes.
- **Clean Code** principles, of course.

## What was missing?

I managed to structure the project well, demonstrating how I work and how best practices in organization can benefit a project. Unfortunately, I only got as far as creating the grid. I didn't have time to finalize the items or integrate them with the data stored in the state. I had to return to work and was away for over an hour within the assessment's allocated time. I believe that without this interruption, I would have been able to complete it.

## Running the project

To install the dependencies, run the following command in the project's root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

To start the application, run:

```sh
npm start
```

Then, open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:1234`

## Final Thoughts

I appreciate the opportunity and hope this project gives you a glimpse of my coding skills and qualities.
